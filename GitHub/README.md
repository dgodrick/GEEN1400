# Using GitHub

There's a really nice GUI gitHub program availabe for Windows and Mac. For most users, that's what I'd recommend. But if you need to  use GitHub from the terminal, here's my notes... and Godspeed.

### Cloaning an existing repository from the internet

    git clone URL_OF_Repository

## Syncing a new folder on your computer to GitHub for the first time

    git init

## Syncing changes to the internet
stage for commit:

     git add .
commit:
    
     git commit -m "commit message"
push

     git push
