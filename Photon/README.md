# Particle Photon

The Particle Photon is one of my favorite micocontrollers. It's small, well documented, inexpensive, and comes with WiFi.

To get started with your new Particle Photon, one of the first things you should do is [install the command line interface (CLI)](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/#installing)

### Getting the MAC address 

To connect to UCB Wireless, you'll have to email [help@colorado.edu](mailto:help@colorado.edu) with your devices' MAC address. To get the mac address:

 1) Connect the Photon to your computer with a USB cable
 2) Hold down the `SETUP` button until the light begins to flash blue.
 3) Open your Terminal App, and type:

	particle serial mac

It normally takes IT about 24 hours to get your device added to CU's network.
