# Simple RF24 Test Circuit

This simple test circuit has two arduinos (In the schematic below I'm using two Arduino Nano, because they're one of my favorite Arduinos). The transmit Circuit has has a button, and the recieve circuit has an LED. When the button is pressed, the transmit circuit sends **"1"** and the recieve circuit turns on the LED.  When the button is released, the transmit circuit sends **"0"** and the recieve circuit turns off the LED.
