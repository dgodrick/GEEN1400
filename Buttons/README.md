Using Buttons
=============

Buttons seem like the simplest sensor, and that can often lull you to think they'll be the easiest to hook up; however, an improperly connected button will behave erratically and give you a lot of headaches. 

Hooking up a button
===================
Using a Pull-Up resistor (recommended)
--------------------------------------
The recommended method to attach a button is using a "pullup resistor." The best resistor to use for this is a 10kÎ©.

	 #define buttonPin 2
     void setup(){
     	pinMode(buttonPin,INPUT);
     }

     void loop(){
     	if(digitalRead(buttonPin)==LOW)
     		//The button was pressed
     }

Using the internal pullup resistor
----------------------------------
Alternitvly, the microcontroller has in internal resistor built in. This circuit does not need an external resistor.

To activate the internal resistor you need to use `INPUT_PULLUP` in the `setup()` function:

	 #define buttonPin 2
     void setup(){
     	pinMode(buttonPin,INPUT_PULLUP);
     }

     void loop(){
     	if(digitalRead(buttonPin)==LOW)
     		//The button was pressed
     }


Coding the button
=================
### Using digitalRead()

The easy way to check if a button is pressed is using `digitalRead()`. In all of my examples, if `digitalRead(buttonPin)==LOW` the button is pressed, and if `digitalRead(buttonPin)==HIGH` the button _is not_ pressed.  

This is counter-intuitive for most engineers, so I'll reiterate:

| Button State | `digitalRead()` | 
| :-----------:|:---------------:|
| Button **IS** pressed | LOW  |
| Button **IS NOT** pressed | HIGH | 

It's important to note that it can be easy for the Arduino to miss a button press using `digitalRead()` if there are other things going on. Take this example:
     
     void loop(){
     	digitalRead(buttonPin);
     	delay(10000)
     }

The microcontroller is checking for the button press for 1 ms every 10 seocnds. that means if I push the button and release it during the `delay()`, the microcontroller will never know I pushed the button. For this code to work properly, the user will have to hold the button down, on average, for 5 seconds until the controller recognizes the button is pressed. You can solve this problem by: 

 * [avoiding delays](https://github.com/mrsoltys/GEEN1400/tree/master/Avoiding%20Delays) 
 * setting your button up as in Interrupt, as discussed in the next section.

### As an Interrupt (Advanced, but very useful)

Pins 2 and 3 on the Arduino can be set up to "Interrupt" the code. This means the code will pause, do a specific action, and then resume where it left off.
