Avoiding Delays
===============

Delays can keep your arduino from living up to its full potential! They pause the brain, when it in reality could be doing other useful things! These codes provide some examples to do some common functions like blinking a LED or sweeping a servo, without ever using the delay() function! This means they'll work, even if your arduino is doing other things!
